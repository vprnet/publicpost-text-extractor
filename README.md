text-summarize
==============

A very simple and I mean very simple HTTP wrapper on top of the Summarize gem. Call /summarize?text=TEXT_HERE and you'll get the summarized text. Only other param is "ratio" which allows you to control how much the text is compacted.

Deployed on Heroku at: http://text-summarize.herokuapp.com/summarize?text=Your text to be summarized here&ratio=50
